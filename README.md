Docmanage is an open-source, industrial-grade commandline tool that allows managing classified/sensitive documents, offering 256-bit security.

## Usage
### First run
When running the app for the first time, when prompted for a key, press ENTER without typing anything. The application will then generate a key for you. **Store it safely.**
> [!CAUTION]
>
> Losing your key means you will be locked out of your data!

> [!TIP]
>
> For storing keys safely, we recommend external services, such as:
> * Google Password Manager
> * Bitwarden Password Manager
> * Proton Password Manager
> * writing it down on a piece of paper

### Warm run
When you start the app, enter the key that was generated for you on the first run.
> [!CAUTION]
>
> While technically possible, entering a custom key is NOT recommended and introduces several security vulnerabilities.
> Only do this if you want to enter a key that was randomly generated by another application, or are simply testing the app.

Afterwards, you will see a menu listing all available files. To create one, select "Create File" (using the arrow keys) and hit enter.
